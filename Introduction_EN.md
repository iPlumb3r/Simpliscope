# Dichoscope

Introduction
-
Just as the __microscope__ allows us to see big what is small and the __telescope__ allows us to see near what is far, the __dichoscope__ allows us to "see" simply what is complex.

But unlike the __microscope__ and the __telescope__, it is not possible to buy a __dichoscope__ from any store in town, or even to order one on the Internet!

In fact, the __dichoscope__ is an intangible tool, without any physical reality, which only allows (but it is already a lot ;-) to realize "thought experiments" with an analytical purpose ...

Setting in context
-
When designing a __computer application__ to support __business activities__, the __semantic model of the business concepts__ is a key component of the requirements specification because it ensures that the __solution__ that will be parameterized and/or developed will meet the expected __uses__ and expressed __needs__.

Purpose
-
The __dichoscope__ is a methodological tool for knowledge engineering is essentially "made up" of the __principle of separation of considerations_ and __semantic lenses_ which allows to significantly increase the level of relevance of the __semantic model of the business concepts__ to be designed.

Remark: the _principle of separation of considerations_ (also called principle of separation of concerns or principle of separation of aspects) is better known under its Anglo-Saxon name of "Separation Of Concerns Principle". 

Principle
-
The _principle of "Separation Of Concerns"_ makes it possible to study the different __aspects__ of a product or system and considers it good practice to "separate" (in the sense of "formally distinguish") the __aspects__ that fall under different "logics".

Semantic lenses are "elementary" semantic models for observing a __field of knowledge in order to model it in the most relevant way possible. They are subdivided into the following categories :

 * generic: i.e. relating to knowledge domains in general
 * specific: i.e. relating to a particular area of knowledge

The axis of analysis embodied by each __aspect__ is generally structured by a dichotomy (or even a trichotomy), which means that the thing observed is either of one "nature" or of the other, but cannot be of both, and that it must therefore obey this alternative requirement.
